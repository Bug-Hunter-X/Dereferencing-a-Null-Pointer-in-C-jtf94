This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version of the code, which avoids the error by properly checking for null before dereferencing the pointer.  The solution highlights safe pointer usage in C.
